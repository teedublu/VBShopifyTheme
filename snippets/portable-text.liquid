    This snippet is used to render a portable text block. It looks through each block and render the correct partial based on the block type.
    If you have custom blocks, you can add them here. We've got a couple of examples here to render an accordion and a callout, which will work in Shopify's Dawn theme out of the box. The Sanity schema for these blocks is provided in the readme.
